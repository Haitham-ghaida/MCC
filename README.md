# Project Name: Prospective Dynamic LCA of a Building Renovation Case Study

# Group members: Haitham Ghaida, Marin Pellan, Martin Rit, Miguel Louis, Moni Aridi, Thibault Goessel, Dalia Abdelfattah

# Description:
This Project was part of the Autumn School for Open Approaches to Time in LCA offered by [DÃ©part de Sentier, AKA DdS](https://www.d-d-s.ch/).

## Idea:
Run building LCA in combination with a building energy simulation with multiple renovation scenarios for a building case study.

The main idea is to switch the ecoinvent background database to databases generated by (premise)[https://github.com/polca/premise] of processes that occur at a specific time.

The model for the building energy simulation can be found in the simulation dir, and the model for the LCA can be found in the L420A dir.

The project is simply a prototype. Testing and optimization of the code are still unfinished.

There is a file jupyter nb called 'test.ipynb' which we used to test out the model.
